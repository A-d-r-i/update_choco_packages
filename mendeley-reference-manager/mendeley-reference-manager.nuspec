## Mendeley Reference Manager v2.107.0
 
We have:
 
- Enhanced the functionality of the Library search tool, improving both speed and accuracy
- Implemented search match highlighting in the Library table
- Implemented the feature to export all references from a collection in the user's preferred format
- Implemented a feature that retains the 'last read position' in a PDF, allowing users to resume reading from where they left off upon reopening the document

 
We have fixed:

- An issue where highlighted search terms in PDFs were disappearing when switching between documents
- An issue where the 'Author' metadata panel field was causing the application to crash
