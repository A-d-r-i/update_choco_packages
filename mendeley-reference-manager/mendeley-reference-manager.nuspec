## Mendeley Reference Manager v2.138.0

We have:

- improved the table view of the library so that it resizes with your window
      and also made it more responsive
- introduced the ability to create underline annotations in the PDF reader
- added options to the right-click and highlight menus in the PDF reader,
      including copy
- added a ‘back’ button to the PDF reader that takes you back to the
      previous location after having clicked a link


We have fixed:

- an issue preventing you closing the app with command/Ctrl+Q
- the command/Ctrl+C shortcut on text and underline highlights
