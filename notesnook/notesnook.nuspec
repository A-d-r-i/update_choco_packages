    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>

    <releaseNotes>## :star2: Features &amp; new stuff

### Introducing Notesnook Web Clipper

Notesnook now has its very own web clipper allowing you to quickly save full pages &amp; snippets while scrolling the web. **It is still alpha-beta software so bugs are expected.**

![web-clipper-firefox](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7473959/205875235-a1f9bf2e-ee23-49d0-ad42-64d612cec89f.gif)

#### How it works?

- The web clipper communicates directly with the web app to save your clips so you must keep an instance of the Notesnook Web App running in the background.
- Web clipping is not yet supported on mobile devices (but will be).
- Currently the extension is not listed on any store (but that'll be happening soon) so you'll have to side load the extension.
    - **For Google Chrome/Chromium:**
         - [Download the .zip archive](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/releases/download/v2.3.0/notesnook-web-clipper-chrome-0.1.0.zip)
         - Go to chrome://extensions/
         - Turn on Developer Mode (toggle in the top-right corner)
         - Drag &amp; drop the .zip archive
    - **For Firefox:**
         - [Download the .xpi file](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/releases/download/v2.3.0/notesnook-web-clipper-firefox-0.1.0.xpi)
         - Open about:addons
         - Drag &amp; drop the .xpi file
