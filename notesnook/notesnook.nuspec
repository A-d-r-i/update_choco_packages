    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>

    <releaseNotes>## :star2: Features &amp; new stuff

1. **Faster app startup** ??? _in Notesnook performance is a feature_. The desktop app now starts up in 0.2 seconds and becomes fully functional &amp; ready in ~2.3 seconds. That's down from ~3.9 seconds. Here's a comparison:

3. **Copy to clipboard on codeblocks** ??? All codeblocks now show a copy to clipboard button on hover (always visible on mobiles).
4. **No more update notices on startup** ??? starting from this release, you will no longer see update notices whenever you start the app.

## :bug: Fixes &amp; improvements

1. Fix toolbar button alignment in editor by @ammarahm-ed in [#2876](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/pull/2876)
2. Fix gray placeholder shown on re-inserting an already uploaded image by @thecodrr in [#2878](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/pull/2878)
3. Force upate token if email is already confirmed by @thecodrr in [#2879](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/pull/2879). This will get rid of the "Please confirm your email..." error even though you already confirmed your email.
5. Do not cache images without an hash i.e. pasted images by @thecodrr in [#2881](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/pull/2881). This fixes the bug where pasting different images consistently showed the same image until you restarted the app.
6. Changing account password is now possible again from web/desktop Settings by @thecodrr in [#2880](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/pull/2880)
