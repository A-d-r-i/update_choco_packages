    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
