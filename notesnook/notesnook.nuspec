    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

    <releaseNotes>## :star2: Features &amp; new stuff

### New backup format (.nnbackupz)

After the introduction of Sync v2, we realized that our backup format was not really suitable for huge amounts of data. A single JSON file works for a few thousand items but fails quite miserably after 10K items mark. With this release, we are introducing a new format for backups.

**Note: all old backups can still be imported without issues.**

The new format (.nnbackupz) is a chunked ZIP based format containing multiple .nnbackup files allowing users to backup millions of notes without issues. We have also added support for streaming during backup creation &amp; restore to prevent any OOM (out of memory) issues on low-end devices. An added benefit of this new format is smaller backups due to ZIP compression. I have personally noticed upto 90% reduction in size of backups (YMMV).

## :bug: Fixes &amp; improvements

1. Fixed a bunch of sync related issues produced after Sync v2 causing some items to never sync
2. Fix login form shown for split second before login completes
3. Fix issue where app wouldn't ask for verification before creating a backup with backup encryption turned off
4. Improve UI of code blocks &amp; language selection popup
