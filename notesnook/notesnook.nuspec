    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>

    <releaseNotes>## :star2: Features &amp; new stuff

1. **Cross-platform reminders** ??? Reminders are finally here! You can set a one-time reminder or daily, monthly &amp; weekly recurring reminders. All reminders are automatically synced to all your devices.
2. **Sync controls** ??? We are giving you full control over the whole syncing process. Disable auto sync, real-time editor sync or turn it off completely for an offline experience ??? it's up to you.
3. **Privacy mode on Desktop** ??? The mobile app has had privacy mode for many, many versions and now desktop app gets it too. Privacy mode will exclude Notesnook from all kinds of screen capture i.e., you can safely take notes while sharing your screen; the other person won't be able to see the Notesnook app. (Works only on macOS &amp; Windows)
4. **Changing your account email** is now possible (and it works just like you expect it to :D).
5. **New &amp; improved login flow** ??? (this deserves its very own blog post) we are taking Notesnook security up a notch by redesigning how our login works. After much brainstorming, we realized that your account password is the most important credential &amp; keeping it safe should be our foremost priority. To that end, we have moved password entry to be the last step in login. Here's how it works:
   1. Enter email
   2. Authenticate second factor (can be email, sms or authenticator app)
   3. Enter password
   4. And finally you are logged in.
6. **Improve PDF &amp; HTML exports** ??? Export formats are finally getting some love in this release. The exported PDFs (and HTML) should now properly format &amp; style your task lists, code blocks, quotes, tables etc.
7. **Delete notes with a notebook/topic** ??? Deleting a notebook/topic now gives you the option to also delete all the notes inside it.
8. Images in editor now show a download button on selection (just like in attachments)
9. Bypass CORS (using a configurable CORS proxy) when downloading &amp; attaching images in editor ??? this allows Notesnook to download any &amp; all external images you throw at it.
10. **Improved sync status** ??? Sync status now correctly shows offline/disabled sync states. It also doesn't auto reset after a sync failure making it clear to you if a sync has failed.
