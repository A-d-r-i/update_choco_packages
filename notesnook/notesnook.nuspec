    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>

    <releaseNotes>## :star2: Features &amp; new stuff

### Custom themes

We have redesigned the Notesnook theme engine to add support for user specified custom themes. That means you, me, or anyone else can now easily change how Notesnook looks!

![pika-1691391098738-1x](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/assets/7473959/e1e948ce-a1dc-433a-b52a-64a4530f3b69)

_Here's how the Monokai theme looks._

&gt; **Note:**
&gt;
&gt; We are still working on documentation &amp; tooling around how to create your own theme. Give us a [follow on Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/notesnook) so you can know about it as soon as it lands!

### Vericrypt is open source again!

Vericrypt source code was unpublished when we open sourced Notesnook last year. However, due to recent demand it has been updated and made open source again. Yay to transparency and privacy! Check out the code [here](https://github.com/streetwriters/notesnook/tree/master/apps/vericrypt).

_If you don't know what Vericrypt is: it's a very user friendly way to very all the encryption claims of Notesnook fully offline and in your browser. It provides step-by-step instructions on how to extract raw data from your browser's database &amp; then decrypt is using your very own encryption key. All in the browser. You can [try it out here!](https://vericrypt.notesnook.com/)_

### Much, much improved copy/pasting

Before this release, copying or pasting anything into or out of Notesnook would result in unpredictable and weird formatting. All that has now been fixed. Notesnook now tries very, very hard to preserve the source formatting of the copied or pasted content. To give you a few examples:

1. Copying a single list item no longer copies it as a list but as a paragraph
2. Copying multiple list items no longer add empty lines around each list item
3. Copying content to &amp; from Notesnook now follows the `Double spaced paragraph` setting. In English this means that, people who have disabled double spaced paragraphs will no longer see paragraphs with double the spacing when pasting content into Notesnook and vice versa.

### Syntax highlighting and rendered Math in exports

Starting from this version, whenever you print or export a note that has Math Blocks or Codeblocks, Notesnook will automatically pre-render it so it looks awesome everywhere.
