    <description>Notesnook is a free (as in speech) and open source note taking app focused on user privacy and ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` and `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. Our goal is to provide users peace of mind and 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

**32 bit users**: This package is not available for 32 bit users.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
    <summary>A fully open source and end-to-end encrypted note taking alternative to Evernote.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>## :star2: Features &amp; new stuff

1. **Native encryption/decryption on desktop** ??? we have rewritten the desktop side of things to add support for 100% native encryption using libsodium. On users' side, this means faster syncing, attachment uploading, login &amp; everything else encryption related.
2. **New UI for Settings** ??? Notesnook Settings have been revamped to better confirm with the desktop form factor. There's now a search too!
3. **Automatic backups are now disabled by default** ??? this was a potential security risk where logging in on a public device would download a backup to the users' device. This now requires manually turning on automatic backups for each device.
4. **Encrypted backups for all** ??? we are enabling encrypted backups for all Pro &amp; Basic users by default!
5. Web Clipper has been updated to v0.2.2 fixing a very critical bug. Download the update from [here](notesnook.com/notesnook-web-clipper/).
