    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Added a new tutorial. For new installations, it can be launched from the setup window. For all users, it can be launched from Tartube's menu (About &gt; Show tutorial)
- MS Windows users can now select a dark theme for Tartube windows. In Tartube's menu, click 'System &gt; Change theme...'. Advanced users may be able to install additional themes; see the README for more details. Thanks to Rukongai for finding the solution (Git #[355](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/355))
- Channels, playlists and folders can now have non-unique names; for example you can have separate channels, both called 'Season 1', inside different folders. However, you can't have two channels with the same name inside the same folder (Git #[439](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/439))
- Download options can now be applied directly to more than one channel, playlist or folder (Git #[464](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/464))
- Tartube has been re-licensed under LGPL 2.1
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- New translations available: French, Russian, Spanish and Vietnamese. Thanks to everyone at Weblate who contributed to them, including Le Sharko√Øste, Tim Dewey, Equi and Zeref. In this release, your system's locale should be applied automatically (no more messing around in the preferences window)
- Python errors, which until now were hidden in a terminal window (and therefore not visible to must users), are now redirected to Tartube's Errors/Warnings tab where everyone can see them
- In download options, Post-processing &gt; General, the audio quality of the post-processed audio file can now be set as a specific bitrate (e.g. [320](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/320) kb/s), as well as the 'high', 'medium' and 'low' settings that were already available (Git #[462](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/462))
# MAJOR FIXES
- In the system preferences window, 'Downloaders' tab, tightened up the behaviour of the buttons, entries and comboboxes so that the user cannot specify contradictory settings or enter invalid values. On MS Windows, the 'Use custom path' setting is now marked as 'not recommended', because Tartube code assumes that all users are using the official Tartube installer. (It it apparently possible to install Tartube using WSL2, but the authors have not been able to confirm that, so for the moment WSL2 installations are not 'officially' supported) (Git #[466](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/466))
- Fixed errors in the file-tidying operation (from Tartube's menu, Operations &gt; Tidy up files) (Git #[423](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/423), #[463](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/463))
- .webp thumbnail images cannot be displayed in Tartube's window (because the Gtk graphics libraries do not support them). By default, .webp thumbnails are converted to .jpg (which are supported), but in some circumstances this prevents users from embedding thumbnails into their videos. In this version, when .webp thumbnails are converted to .jpg, the original .webp files are not deleted (and so they are still available for embedding). You can change this behaviour in Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Operations &gt; Downloads. You can use 'Operations &gt; Tidy up files...' to remove multiple .webp files at a later date, if you want to (Git #[461](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/461))
- Drag and drop into the 'Add new videos' window did not work as intended, if videos were dropped directly onto the textview. Specifically, a newline character was not inserted between existing and new URLs. This issue also affected several similar windows, but is now fixed
- When videos were downloaded as audio files (e.g. .m4a) and then converted to another type of audio file (e.g. .mp3), Tartube's database was not updated correctly. Due to some invisible magic in the operating system, most users did not notice any problems, but some did. Fixed the issue, so that new downloads will update the database correctly (Git #[451](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/451))
# MINOR FIXES
- In download options, Files &gt; Filesystem, the 'Download all videos into this folder' has been fixed so that it works correctly in non-English locales
- Fixed drag-and-drop into the 'Media' tab of the 'Scheduled download' window
- In the 'Add many channels/playlists' windows, names and URLs in the box at the bottom were supposed to be editable, but were not. Fixed
- Fixed a rare problem for videos that were marked to be watched as soon as they are downloaded, in which it was possible (in principle) to delete the video before the media player was launched, causing numerous problems
- After fetching a list of video formats/subtitles, the dialogue window's button opened the download options window at the wrong tab. Fixed
- In the Drag and Drop tab, code did not impede the user's attempts to delete the 'general' (default) set of download options (which cannot be deleted). Fixed
- Some youtube-dl commands surround download options with double quotes "...". For technical reasons, these must be removed before Tartube can start a youtube-dl download. Users were confused that the double quotes they had specified were not visible in the Output tab; they are now visible there (and also in the terminal window, when that is enabled) (Reddit)
- The preferences window, when opened, will now auto-fix any problems with sets of download options in the Tartube database. This is a temporary patch for an unresolved issue. The authors suspect the unresolved issue has resolved itself, given that code handling applied download options has been completely re-written for this release (Git #[456](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/456))
