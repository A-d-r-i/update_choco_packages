In these cases, Tartube will now add a video to its database, marked as blocked/unavailable for download.

Blocked videos are always visible when a filter is applied (as long as they match the filter)
- Scheduled downloads can now be set to start at certain of the day and week, or at some specified time after Tartube starts (Git #[362](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/362))
