    <releaseNotes>
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Added 'stop download' conditions for each individual scheduled download (in the scheduled download's edit window, click the 'Stop' tab). These conditions, if enabled, override the global conditions visible in Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Operations &gt; Stop (Git #[563](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/563))
- In the Classic Mode tab, when one-click downloads were enabled, after adding a duplicate URL to the box at the top of the tab, the URL was not downloaded. Worse still, when the user tried to manually remove the duplicate URL, Tartube crashed. Fixed (#[566](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/566))
- System commands displayed in the Output tab, terminal window and/or logs now include quotes "..." around arguments containing whitespace, so the commands can be copy-pasted elsewhere (for example, into a new terminal window). This issue only affects the way commands are displayed; the actual system command sent to the system has not changed (Git #[576](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/576))
# MAJOR FIXES
- Initial fix for an error generated by MS Windows, when writing yt-dlp to a logfile (Git #[557](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/557))
- Fixed python key error on startup (Git #[558](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/558)) and a python index error for an unknown video URL (Git #[564](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/564))
- Fixed drag-and-drop error when dragging from the Errors/Warnings tab on MS Windows. Also added a button in that tab to copy the selected lines to the system clipboard (#[559](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/559))
- In each Video's properties window, Tartube was in some situation unable to display video comments. Fixed (Git #[565](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/565))
- Dragging a video from the 'Missing Videos' folder to another folder created a new video in Tartube's database. Fixed (Git #[561](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/561))
- Fixed an error caused when trying to create a new profile, due to a typo in the code
# MINOR FIXES
- When counting the number of videos in the 'Missing Videos' folder, Tartube counted each video three times. This generated errors when doing a database integrity check. Fixed (#[561](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/561))
- In the README, updated the MacOS installation guides, following advice from a user (Git #[571](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/571))
- Reduced the ridiculously wide width of the 'Database check complete' window
