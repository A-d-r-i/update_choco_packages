    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Tartube can extract a video's comments, and optionally store them in its own database. (In either case, comments are stored in the video's .info.json file). This feature is only available when using yt-dlp. To enable it, click 'Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Operations &gt; Comments', and select 'When checking/downloading videos, store comments in the metadata file', (Note that the download option in 'Edit &gt; General download options...' has been removed). To view comments for a video, right-click the video and select 'Show video &gt; Properties &gt; Comments'
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- In the preferences window (Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Windows &gt; Main window), the 'Reset' button now resets the position of various sldiers, as well as the size of the main window
- Added a few more video/audio formats to the list selectable in the download options window
- In the video slices dialogue window (right-click a video and select 'Special &gt; Remove video slices...') the user can now opt to remove a slice, or to remove everything but a slice. The latter behaviour is slightly different to downloading a video clip, because downloading a clip will create a new entry in Tartube's database. The new button should clarify what the window is actually supposed to do (Git #[322](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/322))
- In the new-ish dialogue window that appears when nothing is downloaded, there is a new section remnnding Classic Mode users that they can't download a file that doesn't exist (and what to do about that) (Git #[326](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/326))
- The same dialogue window appeared after checking a single video that had previously been checked/downloaded. Fixed
- The setup dialogue window now explains to users what the Classic Mode tab is for, and lets them specify that the main window should always open at that tab, if they want
# MAJOR FIXES
- The button to set the media file in a video's edit window did not work on MS Windwos. Fixed (Git #[320](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/320))
- In the Progress tab, the 'Maximum downloads' setting was broken. Fixed
- Fixed an error caused when a video's upload date (as returned by youtube-dl) was None
# MINOR FIXES
- .webp thumbnails from Odysee (and perhaps other websites) were not converted into a displayable format; fixed
