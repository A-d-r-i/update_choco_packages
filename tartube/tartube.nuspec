    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- In the Videos tab, you can mark one or more channels/playlists/folders to be downloaded by clicking the checkbuttons next to their names. Tartube can now remember which items have been marked, storing them in a profile: in the main menu, click Media &gt; Profiles &gt; Create profile. You can create as many profiles as you like, and switch between them whenever you like. See the README for more information (Git #[409](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/409))
- During a download, you can now right-click a channel, playlist or folder to add it to the download; previously, the menu item was greyed out (Git #[430](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/430))
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- During Tartube installation, the user is now prompted to choose how often their database file should be backed up. The default setting has also been changed to 'every time' (Git #[427](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/427))
- When the user deletes videos, they will now see a prompt asking for confirmation. The user can choose between removing the video from the database, and deleting the video from the filesystem completely. A comparable prompt already appeared when deleting channels, playlists and folders. In all cases, there is now an 'Always show this window' button which can be de-selected, if convenient (Git #[427](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/427))
- The dropdown box in the 'Add channel' window has been improved to add an explicit item for 'No parent folder', instead of using an empty space. The windows for adding playlists and folders have been updated in the same way. The 'Add video' window has been tweaked to show icons inside the dropdown box, as the other three windows already do
- In each video's properties window, there is a new button which updates the video's data from its metadata file. Also, when the video's file path is changed (manually by the user), the corresponding metadata is now automatically loaded, updating the video in Tartube's database (Git #[414](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/414))
- You can update multiple videos from their metadata by right-clicking them and selecting Special &gt; Reload metadata (Git #[420](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/420))
- The detail of some icons were difficult to make out. They have been replaced with sharper icons
- The list of videos in the Videos tab shows each video's name (which we call a 'nickname'), which is not necessarily identical to the video's file name. You can now switch to displaying video file names instead: Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Windows &gt; Videos &gt; Show nicknames (not video file names) (Git #[417](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/417))
- Tidied up the layout of the popup menu for videos
- In the download options window, in the Files &gt; File names tab, you can now set an output template with a date/time in several different formats (Git #[424](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/424))
- In the same window, added new options for '--live-from-start' and '--wait-for-video' (Git #[431](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/431), yt-dlp only)
# MAJOR FIXES
- In the Videos tab toolbar, when the 'Show downloaded' button is toggled and, as a result, no videos are visible, many of the toolbar icons were greyed out. Fixed (Git #[410](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/410))
- The video's edit window was unable to open under certain circumstances. Fixed
- In a separate issue, the video's edit window was unable to open when the video didn't have a file associated with it. Fixed (Git #[421](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/421)/[422](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/422))
- The list of custom downloads in Tartube's main menu (Operations &gt; Custom download all) was not updated when profiles were added or removed; the list could only be updated by restarting Tartube. Fixed
- In the channel/playlist properties window, in the Associated Playlists tab, the 'Add all playlists' button was broken. Fixed it
# MINOR FIXES
- When setting a custom redirect for Invidious, Tartube added an initial 'www.' which does not always resolve to a valid web address. This no longer happens. Text in the preferences window (Operations &gt; Mirrors) has been updated to reflect this change (Git #[412](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/412))
- Fixed an error in the code that resets channel/playlist/folder markers (selection buttons) in the Video Index
- During a refresh operation, a video's URL, ID and duration were not set, if they had not already been set (Git #[414](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/414))
- When closing a video's properties window, the list of videos in the Video tab was not properly updated when a filter was applied. Fixed (Git #[413](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/413))
- In a video's properties window, in the General tab, when the video file is changed, the entry boxes at the top of the window were not updated. Fixed (Git #[420](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/420))
- In the Drag and Drop tab, two icons of different sizes were used beside each other; this has been fixed
- Fixed missing apostrophes (Git #[411](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/411) and #[416](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/416)), and typos in the download options window (Git #[418](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/418))
- Tweaked the detection of invalid URLs, for example in the 'Add channel' window
- In the download options window, in the Name tab, fixed inconsistent widget layout when switching between simple and advanced options
