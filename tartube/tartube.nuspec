    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR FIXES
- Fixed rare crashes caused by the system tray icon (Git #[577](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/577))
- Fixed failure to add videos/channels/playlists to the Progress List (the top half of the Progress tab) in certain circumstances (Git #[651](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/651))
- In the Classic Mode tab, livestreams would not download when the 'is a livestream' button was selected, but they downloaded just fine when it wasn't selected. Fixed (Git #[643](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/643))
# MINOR FIXES
- Fixed incorrect sorting of videos whose names begin/end with whitespace characters or quotes (Git #[611](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/611))
- In the preferences window, Downloaders &gt; Forks tab, fixed the broken button 'When using other downloaders, filter out youtube-dl options' (Git #[614](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/614))
- Fixed inability to re-download videos when the youtube-dl archive file is enabled (Git #[613](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/613), #[623](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/623))
- In the Classic Mode tab, the 'Clear downloaded' button didn't work for any videos which were not downloaded because of the youtube-dl archive file, when use of that file was enabled. Fixed (Git #[621](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/621))
- In the Custom Download Settings window, the spinbutton to set the maximum delay did not work. Fixed it (Reddit)
- When using the 'strict' installers, it was not possible to set the path to the youtube-dl executable due to more broken buttons. Fixed (Git #[633](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/633))
- Fixed various python errors and warnings generated only by the most recent versions of Python
- In the setup wizard, removed the FFmpeg installation page for users who should not have been able to see it
- While downloading Odysee videos, "Pre-processing" is seen in the Progress tab both before AND after the actual video download. Fixed it
- When DEBUG_FUNC flags are enabled (by editing the source code), tweaked the code so that text is not constantly sent to STDOUT while Tartube is idle
- When changing Tartube's locale in the preferences window, the message 'The new setting will be applied when Tartube restarts" appears in the wrong place, messing up the formatting. Fixed
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Added (traditional) Chinese translation. Thanks to hugoalh
- In the Video Index (the left-hand column in the Videos tab), you can now disable dialogue windows when moving videos/channels/playlists/folders. Click Edit &gt; System preferences &gt; Windows &gt; Dialogues, and deselect the 'Prompt the user..." buttons (Git #[624](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/624))
- Linux users can now use both pip3 or pipx to install or update youtube-dl and other components
