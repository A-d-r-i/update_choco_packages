    <releaseNotes>
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- MS Windows users have been reporting that FFmpeg cannot be installed any more; this release attempts to fix that issue (but I can't be sure that the fix will work)
- In order to cope with yt-dlp spam, added some new ignorable warnings (see Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Windows &gt; Errors/Warnings)
- In Edit &gt; System preferences &gt; Files &gt; URLs, there is a new button for opening a URL in your system's web browser. Also changed the layout of that tab to make it a little easier to understand
# MAJOR FIXES
- When the Tartube database was corrupted, on startup Tartube was unable to create temporary directories, so the application closes even before the main window is created. Fixed that, and also fixed the failure to show a dialogue window when a lock can't be placed on the database file
- Fixed various issues when exporting/importing Tartube's database
- Fixed inability to rename channels/playlists/folders under certain circumstances
# MINOR FIXES
- Fixed minor typos in various edit windows
- When the downloader is yt-dlp and the user selects a custom executable, Tartube installs youtube-dl instead. Fixed (Git #[299](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/299))
- In the same situation (on MS Windows only), Tartube tries to execute an .exe file as if it were a Python script. Fixed (Git #[299](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/299))
- On MS Windows, user could not set an external download path for a channel or playlist. Fixed (Git #[329](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/329))
- Fixed inability to load databases from Tartrubr
