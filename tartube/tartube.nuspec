    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Added complete French translation and partial Turkish translation. Thanks to sydney and PUFF1N
- In the toolbar at the bottom of the Videos tab, added the ability to reverse sort and to sort by numbers in each video's title (for example, so that 'Alan's video 2' can appear before 'My video 1'; so-called 'natural' sorting). Sort settings are now stored in Tartube's database, not in its config file (so Tartube will remember which databases are currently reverse sorted, and which are not, for example) (Git #[477](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/477))
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Handling of locales has been overhauled. Tartube will still switch to your system's locale automatically (when translations are available for it) but, if you prefer, you can force Tartube to use any of the available translations. To do this, open Edit &gt; System preferences (Git #[471](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/471))
- In the Progress/Classic Mode tabs, while checking/downloading videos, improved the format of the column which usually displays '6/9' (meaning 6 out of 9 videos downloaded). In some situations, it displayed information whose meaning was not clear (Git #[474](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/474))
- In the Progress/Classic Mode tabs, in the popup menus, enabled the 'Stop after this video' option for videos that haven't started downloading yet (Git #[481](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/481))
- Added the yt-dlp option '--abort-on-unavailable-fragment' to Tartube's download options windows (Git #[475](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/475))
- Added a few new pages to the tutorial (Help &gt; Show tutorial...). In Tartube's setup window, added some emphasis to the button that opens the tutorial, so that more new users notice it
- In the toolbar at the top of Tartube's main window, added new buttons to open preferences and download options
- Updated the imported XDG code by Scott Stevenson to
