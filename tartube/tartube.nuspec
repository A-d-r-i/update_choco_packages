    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Added (simplified) Chinese translation. Thanks to archblue
- Tartube's handling of video clips and video slices has been completely rewritten, adding many new capabilities, and fixing some bugs. Clips and sliced videos can now be created in both the Videos tab and the Classic Mode tab. Support for yt-dlp's own clipping/slicing capabilities has been added. For more information on the new features, see the README (Git #[523](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/523))
- You can now download videos, one at a time, specifying the name of each downloaded file. This name overrides the name created by download options; the new feature should be more convenient than updating download options for each video you want to download. In the Videos tab, right-click a video and select Special &gt; Download with name... (Git #[520](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/520))
- The system preferences window (Edit &gt; System preferences...) now hides some tabs and settings; they are revealed when you click the 'Show advanced preferences' button. The behaviour is now exactly like the behaviour of the download options and FFmpeg options windows
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Drag-and-drop from Tartube's Errors/Warnings tab into another application (such as a text editor) has been improved, so that the data transferred can be customised (as is already the case for drag-and-drop from other parts of Tartube's main window). To customise the settings, click Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Windows &gt; Drag
- Output generated by youtube-dl can now be written to a logfile, ytdl-log.log (as well as to the Output tab and/or terminal window). This feature is disabled by default; to enable it, see the settings in Edit &gt; System preferences ... &gt; Output &gt; Downloader log
- In the box at the bottom of the Classic Mode tab, you can now right-click a line and select 'Re-insert URL above', which will move the URL back to the box at the top of the tab (Git #[532](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/532))
- In properties windows for videos, channels, playlists and folders, the 'Listed as' box is now editable. The text of this box is the text visible in the Videos tab; changing it does not change the names of any files on your filesystem. (The so-called nickname could already be changed in popup menus.) (Git #[520](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/520))
- Tweaked the American English 'translation' file to remove a load of pesky British spellings
# MAJOR FIXES
- When text containing URLs is copy/pasted into some boxes (for example, the 'Add new videos' dialogue window), Tartube did not cope well with multiple URLs on the same line, or a valid URL followed by other text. Updated the code to handle these situations better (Git #[517](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/517))
- When the user's system locale is en_MY (or any other Anglophone locale, besides en_GB and en_US), Tartube mishandles the locale, generating python errors. Fixed (Git #[518](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/518))
- Fixed python errors generated when deleting multiple videos in a playlist (Git #[521](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/521))
- Tartube should be able to respond to a livestream that has just started broadcasting (for example, by playing an audio alarm, or by starting to download it). This did not work in all possible situations; fixed (Git #[536](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/536))
- Fixed error in the installation file (setup.py) that installed sound files to the wrong location, rendering them unavailable (Git #[529](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/529))
# MINOR FIXES
- The download statistics visible in the Progress tab (and added in the previous release) are now also visible in the 'Download operation complete' dialogue (Git #[516](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/516))
- When creating a playlist inside a folder, which was itself inside a folder, the playlist was added to the top level of the tree instead. Fixed (Git #[522](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/522))
