    <releaseNotes>
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- Added a new setting, enabled by default, to ignore 'this channel is not live' errors on Twitch. To disable it, click Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Operations &gt; Ignore, and de-select the button 'Ignore The channel is not currently live'. Thanks to Lux-Hue for the patch (Git #[540](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/540), #[541](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/541))
# MINOR FIXES
- In the preferences window, fixed a few buttons and widgets that were broken after the introduction of simple/advanced display modes in the previous release
- Fixed an error that sometimes occurs when using alternative download limits
- Fixed bad handling of yt-dlp's --reject-title option, when the argument contains whitespace (Git #[543](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/543))
- When matching video names while ignoring the last N characters, an exception was thrown. Fixed (Git #[557](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/557))
- Fixed a minor typo in the preferences window, fuund &gt; found
- YouTube messages such as 'Premieres in 6 hours', which are interpreted as an error/warning by yt-dlp, are no longer displayed in Tartube's Errors/ Warnings tab, nor added to the database video's error/warning log
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- In the preferences window, tweaked the layout of the Output &gt; Download log tab to reduce confusion
- Tweaked the dialogue window 'Ran out of input', seen when trying to load a corrupted database file, to add additional instructions (Git #[545](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/545))
- Tweaked the dialogue window 'Failed to load the config file (cannot be read by this version)' to add additional instructions
- In the README, the MacOS installation guides have now been tested by the authors, and are confirmed to be working
