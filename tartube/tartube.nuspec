    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- YouTube Stream Converter has been deprecated, so Tartube no longer supports it. Instead, Tartube now offers livestream downloads using streamlink (https://streamlink.github.io/) or with the video's .m3u manifest
- Livestream detection now works on Odysee and Twitch, as well as on YouTube. Detection should work on other websites, if you set the RSS feed for the channel and playlist manually (see the README for details)
- In the toolbar at the bottom of the Videos tab, you can now filter out downloaded videos, or undownloaded videos. These settings are ignored when a text search/filter is applied; in that situation, the buttons are now greyed out for clarity (Git #[402](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/402))
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- When videos are being checked/downloaded, you can now see the amount of free disk space in the bottom-left corner of the Videos tab
- Added the youtube-dl download options '--no-overwrites', settable from the edit window (Git #[398](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/398))
- Videos with enormous names, but without any space characters, created a tooltip that was longer than the Tartube window itself. Updated line- wrapping code generally, so that it will wrap on underline (underscore) characters, as well as on whitespace
- Column headers in the Errors/Warnings tab are now resizeable (Git #[403](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/403))
- There is now a setting to remove a video from Tartube's database after a certain number of days, complementing the existing setting to delete the video entirely from the user's filesystem. See Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Files &gt; Videos. The minimum value is now 0, so users can remove a downloaded video from the database as soon as it has been downloaded, if they want to (Git #[404](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/404))
- In the download options window, Files &gt; File names tab, the 'autonumber' component has been replaced with 'video_autonumber' and 'playlist_autonumber' components, on the advice of the yt-dlp developers (Git #[406](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/406))
# MAJOR FIXES
- JSON timeouts were causing havoc when checking a video with lots of comments. Tartube now provides two timeout settings: one for checking videos with comments, and one for checking videos without comments. To set them, click Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Operations &gt; Downloads. Also fixed an error that failed to store comments in the database, under certain circumstances. Also added a new setting, so that comments can be stored in the database when checking videos, or when downloading videos (see Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Operations &gt; Comments) (Git #[398](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/398))
- Fixed problems with the Drag and Drop tab, causing python errors on startup (Git #[399](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/399))
- On running out of disk space, load/save was disabled, so the user could not free up space before saving the Tartube database. This no longer happens, but after such an error, no scheduled downloads are started (this is confirmed by a message in the Errors/Warnings tab). Updated the text in the preferences window for clarity, and to show free space in GB rather than MB (Git #[400](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/400))
- Fixed failure to extract a video's URL and duration on certain channels, on MS Windows (Git #[373](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/373))
- Fix inability to load database from an (unspecified) earlier version of Tartube. The error can also be fixed in the existing database integrity check (Git #[405](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/405))
# MINOR FIXES
- On MS Windows, the download option '--windows-filenames' is automatically added, but in the edit window, the same option is not selected. Fixed, so that the option is no longer automatically added, but added only when selected
# (Git #[373](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/373))
- The download option '--trim-filenames' uses a file length that refers to the absolute path, including the directory. Tartube will now ignore the setting if the length is less than the absolute path of the directory itself, to prevents files being downloaded into the wrong place. Added a warning about the option's unexpected behaviour in the window
- The installer for MS Windows now starts Tartube with an environment variable, that prevents Gtk from hiding scrollbars (Git #[401](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/401))
- In the toolbar at the bottom of the Videos tab, the buttons to toggle drawing frames and icons were set the wrong way around. Fixed
- The YouTube 'This live event will begin in 11 minutes' was not recognised as a livestream notification (in some circumstances). Fixed
- On startup, in the Classic Mode tab, the 'Convert to this format' and 'Download in this format' buttons were not set or (de)sensitised correctly. Fixed
- In the download options window, Files &gt; File names tab, the various 'Add' buttons added components to the end of the file extension, rather than the end of the filename. Fixed
- Videos/channels/playlists/folders can no longer be deleted from the popup menus, when preferences or edit windows are open. This should prevent windows belonging to deleted items being visible
- Fixed display problems when moving a channel/playlist/folder to the top level, or dragging one onto another
- All keyboard shortcuts have been checked and updated
