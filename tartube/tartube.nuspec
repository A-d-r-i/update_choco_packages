    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- The installers for MS Windows now include Deno, so there's no need to install it yourself. (Deno is now yt-dlp's recommended Javascript runtime, so users on other platforms should probably install it too) (Git #[749](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/749))
- Videos added to Tartube's database now include the name of the video's author (i.e. the uploader, or the channel name if the uploader is not available). You can re-check your existing videos to automatically update the database. In the toolbar at the bottom of the Videos tab, you can now search videos by author (as well as by video name, etc) (Git #[719](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/719))
- The toolbar at the bottom of the Videos tab has been improved, so that searching for videos (i.e. applying a filter) is much more convenient. A number of explanatory tooltips have also been added there (Git #[719](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/719))
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- You can now auto-delete videos by upload dates, as well as by download date. Click Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Files &gt; Delete, where you can now select 'days since download' or 'days since upload' (Git #[743](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/743))
- Improved the layout of the grid in the Videos tab, making it much more likely that users will see multiple columns (as intended), rather than a single one. This should help (for example) users downloading videos with Japanese- language titles, which take up more horizontal space than expected; video titles are now line-wrapped more efficiently. There is also a new button at the bottom of the Videos tab, which can be clicked to force the grid into 2, 3 or 4 columns (depending on the window size) (Git #[751](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/751))
- Added new menu options for checking/downloading the selected video (Git #[740](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/740))
# MAJOR FIXES
- Fixed Tartube's failure to start and/or load the database, when loading data from a (much) earlier version (Git #[733](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/733), #[737](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/737))
- Fixed code handling temporary downloads (Git #[740](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/740))
# MINOR FIXES
- Improved anti-aliasing and fonts on MS Windows (Git #[730](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/730))
