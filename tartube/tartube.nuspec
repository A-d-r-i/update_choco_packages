    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR NEW FEATURES
- Each channel/playlist/folder in the Videos tab now has a checkbutton. You can select one or more items, if you want to check/download just those items. Click the buttons in the bottom-left corner to do that. Even when items are selected, you can still download everything using the main menu or from the toolbar. The checkbuttons can be hidden, if you don't want them: click Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Videos, and de-select 'Allow each row to be marked for checking/downloading' (Git #[379](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/379))
- New Drag and Drop tab. The tab is divided into a grid. Each zone represents a set of download options. Drag and drop a video from your browser (or a text URL) onto one of these zones, and it is added to the Classic Mode tab, ready for download using the specified download options. Because of Gtk issues, drag and drop from a browser does not work well on MS Windows. All users will receive a new set of download options called 'mp3', unless they already have one with that name
- The layout of the Errors/Warnings tab has been redesigned. It is now fully searchable. All the checkbuttons like 'Show Tartube errors' are now applied immediately, and are reversible. (Previously, they only applied to errors/warnings received in the future)
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- The Classic Mode tab has a new button at the bottom of the tab. When selected, youtube-dl creates an archive file. This is not recommended in most cases; it might be useful for downloading large channels/playlists, if the download might need to be resumed after an interruption (Git #[285](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/285))
- In the download options windows (e.g. Edit &gt; General download options...), when advanced options are visible, the options were previously in a separate yt-dlp tab have been merged into the other tabs. This is because yt-dlp is now the default downloader for nearly all users
- The layouts in the preferences window and several other edit windows have been improved (includes Git #[360](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/360))
- Custom downloads can now skip broadcasting livestreams, or livestreams that have already finished. They can also skip all videos EXCEPT current/former livestreams. New icons in the Videos tab highlights which videos are former livestreams; one for downloaded videos, one for checked videos (Git #[358](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/358))
- Tartube can now open in the system tray. See the new setting in Edit &gt; System preferences &gt; Windows &gt; Tray (Git #[365](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/365))
- Tidy operations can now remove videos without URLs, or duplicate videos, from the Tartube database
- In the video properties window, Timestamps tab, you can now update the list of timestamps manually by clicking the new 'Reset list using copied text' button, and then copy-pasting text into the dialogue window (for example, from the video's description) (Git #[330](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/330))
- Minor changes to the layout of the main window's menu
# MAJOR FIXES
- The dialogue windows for adding channels, playlists and folder dialogues accepted invalid characters and names. Fixed to prevent illegel directory/ folder names on MS Windows, Linux and MacOS (Git #[335](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/335))
- A 'blocked' video (e.g. an age-restricted video from YouTube) remains invisible in the Videos tab, by default, even after it is successfully checked or downloaded (for example, after the user has supplied login credentials). Fixed
- Errors/warnings assigned by Tartube to an individual video were not cleared when the video was checked/downloaded without further errors/warnings. Fixed
- Fixed more crashes due to Gtk issues
- The download options window could not be opened, when the '--cookies-from-browser' option was set with KEYRING and PROFILE components. Fixed (Git #[394](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/394))
- Fix python error when starting Tartube (Git #[366](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/366))
- Fixed video duplication error when downloading videos that already exist on the filesystem
- After right-clicking a video and selecting 'Special &gt; Download video clips' or 'Special &gt; Remove video slices', the dialogue windows had several serious issues. Fixed them
- In the Classic Mode tab, when a channel/playlist download is interrupted before the download is complete, the URL is not remembered for the next session. Fixed (Git #[285](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/285))
# MINOR FIXES
- When checking/downloading produces no new videos, a 'newbie' dialogue is displayed pointing the user to possible solutions. The dialogue was displayed even when youtube-dl encountered videos that had already been downloaded, or that were registered in youtube-dl's archive file. This no longer happens (Git #[368](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/368))
- In the preferences window, Windows &gt; Videos tab, the 'Show today and yesterday as the date, when possible' setting could not be disabled, once enabled. Fixed
- In the edit window for custom downloads, in the Slices tab, the toggle buttons were all broken. Fixed them
- After right-clicking a folder and selecting 'Folder contents &gt; All contents &gt; Empty folder', the text of the dialogue window was gibberish. For this procedure and related ones, improved the dialogue layout and tightened up the code. When emptying videos/channels/playlists/folders from the database (but not removing files on the filesystem), added a new confirmation dialogue (Git #[332](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/332))
- The video properties window did not show clip/chapter titles. Fixed (Git #[330](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/330))
- Improved wording in the 'Add channel' dialogue, specifically to remove the word 'automatically'. Updated the video/playlist/folder dialogues too (Git #[277](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/277))
