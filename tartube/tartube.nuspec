    <releaseNotes>
# WARNING:
- yt-dlp users are experiencing various issues when they try to download certain YouTube videos, particularly age-restricted videos. For a list of known issues, please read this page:
# https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/[3766](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/3766) 
- Tartube users will now see a warning in certain situations (for example, Edit &gt; General download options &gt; Advanced &gt; Authentication) (Git #[662](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/662))
# MAJOR FIXES
- Fixed failure to embed thumbnails in downloaded vidoes, if the thumbnails were set to be deleted after the download. Thumbnails, and other metadata files, are now deleted only at the end of the entire download operations, which should resolve this and all similar problems, both in the Videos tab and the Classic Mode tab (Git #[626](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/626))
- Fixed rare error when trying to load the Tartube database (Git #[653](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/653))
- Fixed crash when the matplotlib is unable to start on the user's system (Git #[592](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/592), #[663](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/663))
# MINOR FIXES
- When a scheduled download starts and the Tartube main window is minimised, it automatically un-minimises itself. Fixed (Git #[664](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/664))
- In the preferences window, Options &gt; Download options tab, fixed the broken 'Refresh List' button
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- You can now re-check a video that has been downloaded (by right-clicking the video and selecting 'Re-check video'. Re-checking will re-download all metatdata files (including the thumbnail), but won't replace the video file itself (Git #[661](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/661))
