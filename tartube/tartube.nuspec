    <releaseNotes>
# MAJOR FIXES
- Fixed mishandling of non-European alphabets on MS Windows. Videos with Japanese and Korean titles, whose download Tartube was unable to detect (and which were therefore not added to the Tartube database), should now be added correctly (Git #[153](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/153), #[251](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/251), #[290](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/290), #[304](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/304), #[318](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/318), #[320](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/320) and numerous others)
- Fixed some incorrect video counts in Tartube's database. This problem is not related to the Japanese/Korean problem, but it occured most often when Tartube failed to detect a Japanese/Korean video download
- Fixed periodic crashes due to Cairo threading issues (Git #[577](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/577))
- Fixed the broken 'portable' installation for MS Windows. If you move the installation folder from one location to another, Tartube will now intercept the 'Fatal error in Launcher: U' message, and tell you how to resolve it: namely, to reinstall youtube-dl/yt-dlp. Reinstallation using Tartube's main menu should now work (Git #[484](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/484), #[494](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/494))
- When additional new databases were created (for example, with 'File &gt; Database preferences... &gt; Add new database'), Tartube did not correctly initiate the new sets of download options called 'general' and 'classic'. In addition, the set of download options called 'mp3' was not created at all. One effect was that the Drag and Drop tab did not have the right appearance. The issue now fixed, but Tartube will not try to 'auto-correct' your sets of download options. You can do this yourself, if appropriate, by clicking 'Edit &gt; System preferences... &gt; Options &gt; Download options', opening each set of options with the 'Edit' button, and then clicking the 'Completely reset all download options...' button
- Fixed inability to sort videos in Tartube folders, for example by clicking the 'Reverse sort' button in the toolbar at the bottom of the Videos tab. Reverse sort worked correctly for Tartube channels and playlists (Git #[611](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/611))
# MINOR FIXES
- When videos are moved to a different folder, the youtube-dl archive file was updated without adding necessary newline characters. Fixed (Git #[580](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/580) again)
- Fixed minor issues with the .deb installer (Lintian complained about various small problems; all of them except the expected ITP bug should now be resolved)
- Fixed ugly Gtk/Pango warning messages, visible only to MS Windows users who were running Tartube from a MinGW terminal window
- Tweaked the downloader auto-detection system, to make yt-dlp rather than youtube-dl the default, in the event that neither can be found, and to eliminate checking for improbable file paths
# MINOR NEW FEATURES
- The FFmpeg options window (in the Videos tab, right-click a video and select 'Special &gt; Process with FFmpeg...') now has, in its Name tab, a new 'Use these options exclusively' button, allowing users to specify an FFmpeg command from scratch (Git #[600](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/600))
- MS Windows users, whose installer includes a copy of FFmpeg, don't need to install FFmpeg again when prompted by Tartube's setup window. The text of the setup window has been tweaked to make this clearer (Git #[609](https://github.com/axcore/tartube/issues/609))
