    <description># Saucedacity: A saucy audio editor

**Please Note**: Will be the new future codebase of Tenacity starting with 1.3

**Saucedacity** is an easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, GNU/Linux, and other operating systems*. Saucedacity is open source software licensed under GPL, version 2 or later.

*macOS is unofficially supported (it is buildable). We lack an actual Mac to test our CI builds on to make sure Saucedacity runs properly.

Features:

- **Recording** from any real, or virtual audio device that is available to the host system.
- **Export / Import** a wide range of audio formats, extendible with FFmpeg.
- **High quality** using 32-bit float audio processing.
- **Clip handles** for easy audio editing.
- **Plug-ins** Support for multiple audio plug-in formats, including VST, LV2, AU.
- **Macros** for chaining commands and batch processing.
- **Scripting** in Python, Perl, or any language that supports named pipes.
- **Nyquist** Very powerful built-in scripting language that may also be used to create plug-ins.
- **Editing** multi-track editing with sample accuracy and arbitrary sample rates.
- **Accessibility** for VI users.
- **Analysis and visualization** tools to analyze audio, or other signal data.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
