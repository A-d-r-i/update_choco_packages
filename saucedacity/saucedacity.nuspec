    <description># Saucedacity: A saucy audio editor

**Please Note**: Will be the new future codebase of Tenacity starting with 1.3

**Saucedacity** is an easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, GNU/Linux, and other operating systems*. Saucedacity is open source software licensed under GPL, version 2 or later.

*macOS is unofficially supported (it is buildable). We lack an actual Mac to test our CI builds on to make sure Saucedacity runs properly.

Features:

- **Recording** from any real, or virtual audio device that is available to the host system.
- **Export / Import** a wide range of audio formats, extendible with FFmpeg.
- **High quality** using 32-bit float audio processing.
- **Clip handles** for easy audio editing.
- **Plug-ins** Support for multiple audio plug-in formats, including VST, LV2, AU.
- **Macros** for chaining commands and batch processing.
- **Scripting** in Python, Perl, or any language that supports named pipes.
- **Nyquist** Very powerful built-in scripting language that may also be used to create plug-ins.
- **Editing** multi-track editing with sample accuracy and arbitrary sample rates.
- **Accessibility** for VI users.
- **Analysis and visualization** tools to analyze audio, or other signal data.

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
    <summary>A free open-source audio editor based on Audacity focusing on general improvements.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>While unexpected, this is a small release intended to bring a few updates to libraries, macOS support, a very slight appearance change, and some project loading performance improvements backported from Audacity.

Note that this release **does not** bring anything from Tenacity. That won't happen until 1.3, which is making some steady changes. If you would like to try out release 1.3, you can check out https://nightly.link/saucedacity/saucedacity/workflows/cmake_build/main.

# Changes compared to 1.2
* Updated libmad submodule to 0.16.3
* **macOS specific changes**:
  * Fixed wrapper failing to launch Saucedacity. Turns out this wrapper hadn't been updated since the project was forked from upstream.
  * Updated app icon.
* Removed system border around our numeric text control.

## Changes from Audacity
* FFmpeg 5.0 is now officially supported
* Improved project loading performance by ~10x.

# Notes on macOS Binaries
* macOS is believed to work on macOS Intel. If you're on Apple Silicon, you will need to use Rosetta 2.
* **Saucedacity binaries for macOS are unsigned.** You will need to go to System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General and click "Open Anyway" if you attempted to run Saucedacity with Gatekeeper enabled.</releaseNotes>
