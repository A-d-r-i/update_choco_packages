### The Journals: Tracking Your Daily Routine and Ideas

https://github.com/toeverything/AFFiNE/assets/3468483/d3018fe4-90e6-4cf6-8c2f-82694cd9733c

With our new **Journals**, you can keep track of your daily thoughts, ideas, and experiences. You can find the feature in the left sidebar, and click on **dates** in the right sidebar to easily view documents created and updated on that day

### Enhanced Linked Docs: New Stylish Card Views for Selective Display
Our enhanced Linked Doc allows you to easily input or create links within your documents. This update offers the choice about how these links and their view are displayed, enabling a more personalized touch to your documents. Especially useful on the whiteboard, it supports a more flexible document organization and improved visualization process.

### Collections &amp; Tags: Your Recipe for Document Organization
Now 0.12.0 version has added a page, **collection and tag**, to enhance your document management in Affine. These features allow you to organize your documents in two distinct ways. With an **expanded space in the paging area**, you can quickly locate and retrieve files, streamlining the search process. The introduction of these new filters significantly increases the flexibility of the All Pages view, offering you a more efficient and user-friendly document management experience. This update is designed to adapt to your unique organizational needs, making document handling more intuitive and effective.

### Control Your Own Content: The Ability to Decide The Visibility of Content
With our newly introduced Display Mode function, you can display certain content selectively. All you need to do is switch to the Edgeless Mode and choose your preferred **Display Mode** option. You can showcase more flexible and differentiated content structures tailored to various needs then!
