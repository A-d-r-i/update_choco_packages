    <description>Dot Browser is proud to be powered by Gecko.

There are a plethora of Chromium based browsers available and introducing competition is unique, healthy, and necessary in the browser space.

We chose Gecko due to its position as the best competitor to Chromium, and because it‚Äôs developed by Mozilla, who are best known for their privacy efforts in the community.

    <summary>üåç Dot Browser is a privacy-conscious web browser based on Firefox, developed for Windows, macOS, and Linux.</summary>
    <releaseNotes># This build contains known UI bugs. Please read the information below before installing

## ???? Welcome
You may be a little confused as to why this is the latest build. Dot Browser is currently undergoing a complete rewrite of the frontend. Keeping up with updating patches for newer Firefox versions became near to impossible, so we've decided to rewrite the whole frontend of the browser. Because of this, we've paused builds until we have something a little more stable. 

We hope you understand, and we are hoping to get some builds released very shortly!

## ???? Information

This is a Nightly build meaning you will encounter bugs and things that don't seem right. If you ever come across a bug in a nightly build, please [open an issue on our bug tracker](https://github.com/dothq/browser/issues/new).

## ???? Installation

### Windows

Run the `Install.Dot.Browser.*.exe` to start installing Dot Browser onto your computer.

### macOS

1. Download the `Dot.Browser.*.dmg` image file and mount it by double clicking it.
2. Drag `Dot Browser.app` to the Applications Shortcut.
3. Run Dot Browser, you will encounter a security error.
4. Go to System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy and click Open Anyway.

If you need more help, you can visit the [Dot Browser macOS Help Center.](https://www.notion.so/Dot-Browser-macOS-Help-1be7c9944f484d9ab632fd87b98f1889)
You will find more detailed instructions, including screenshots as well as instructions for changing the icon to fit the rest if you use Big Sur or later.

The reason this message appears is because Apple requires software on macOS to be notarized by them, and Dot Browser does not currently have this notarization.
