 Made 3.2 alpha2 release.
 * bugfix: transaction lost problem, due to xml entities not escaped. Data using "'>&< in name were well saved the 1st time but
           the glib xmlparser was crashing and not warn about it at reload, so if saved again, the data were lost :-/
 * bugfix: description & info transaction field were impossible to blank
 * bugfix: empty field were badly saved with '(null)' instead of ''
 * bugfix: a change in the wallet dialog was not enabling to save
