    <description>Tenacity is an easy-to-use multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, macOS, Linux and other operating systems. It is built on top of the widely popular [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org/) and is being developed by a wide, diverse group of volunteers.

**Are you coming from [Audacium](https://github.com/Audacium/audacium) or [Saucedacity](https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/saucedacity-legacy)? You're in the right place!** We'd like to welcome all Audacium and Saucedacity users to Tenacity and our community. We've implemented new features from Audacity 3.1 to make editing easier. Additionally, we've preserved the themes of these two forks with only very slight modifications so they look better with our new editing features and slight track changes.

## Features

- **Recording** from audio devices (real or virtual)
- **Export / Import** a wide range of audio formats (extensible with FFmpeg)
- **High quality** including up to 32-bit float audio support
- **Plug-ins** providing support for VST, LV2, and AU plugins
- **Scripting** in the built-in scripting language Nyquist, or in Python, Perl and other languages with named pipes
- **Editing** arbitrary sampling and multi-track timeline
- **Accessibility** including editing via keyboard, screen reader support and narration support
- **Tools** useful in the analysis of signals, including audio

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
    <summary>Tenacity is an easy-to-use, privacy-friendly, FLOSS, cross-platform multi-track audio editor for Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems https://tenacityaudio.org</summary>
    <releaseNotes>This is a quick minor release fixing compatibility with wxWidgets 3.2.4. Our PortAudio vckpg port has also been updated to revision 8a9ebfd29f2818d6ce6e8b6c3b9e3cccce0e0691, which brings support for PulseAudio as a direct backend on Linux if you build Tenacity with vcpkg manually (we use a git version in vcpkg for Windows).

**Note**: FFmpeg for Windows is still on 6.0. The next release, 1.3.4, will feature FFmpeg 6.1 if testing goes well. As always, if you find a bug, [please report it](https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/tenacity/issues).

**Note 2**: The AppImage targets Rocky Linux 9, so any equivalent distro should work fine with the AppImage. Be aware that Arch and its derivatives might have problems. See below for more details.

# Release Advisories

We're adding this section to document important issues that you may encounter. We have a few advisories below:

## When launching the AppImage, I get `symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libjack.so.0: undefined symbol: pw_thread_fill_attr`

You might see this error on Arch Linux, Manjaro, or any other Arch-based system. Tenacity's bundled version of JACK, used only if a system version of JACK isn't found, might not work on every distro. To work around this, install your systems regular JACK dependencies. For example, on Arch Linux and Manjaro, install the `jack2` package.

## All plugins are disabled, and enabling them doesn't work

As a workaround, delete pluginregistry.cfg and pluginsettings.cfg from your configuration directory (~/.var/app/org.tenacityaudio.Tenacity/config on Linux under Flatpak, C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Tenacity under Windows). You will need to re-enable any plugins you had enabled previously.

## Your latency setting reads as samples instead of milliseconds in preferences

Change the unit back to milliseconds. Alternatively, you can use the new default of 512 samples. See the changelog for more details. If you only use the default settings, it is generally recommended that you reset you preferences.

## On Linux, JACK isn't available using the Flatpak but the appropriate packages are installed

JACK is supported via Pipewire through the Flatpak. If your distro uses PulseAudio, consider setting up Pipewire if you can. Please consult your distro's documentation on how to setup Pipewire. Alternatively, you can use the AppImages, but those are provided as-is.

If your distro already has Pipewire setup by default but you still don't see the JACK option, try installing your distro's Pipewire JACK support package.

## On Linux Mint, the Flatpak doesn't start

Follow the instructions here: https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/3332. The instructions refer to Audacity but they also apply to Tenacity.

## Some help buttons point to nonexistent documentation

We haven't been able to update all help buttons because we are still developing the manual. Whenever we update the manual to cover new content, we will update these broken links. If interested, you can help us develop the manual here: https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/tenacity-manual.</releaseNotes>
