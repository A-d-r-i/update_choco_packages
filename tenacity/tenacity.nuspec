    <description>Tenacity is an easy-to-use multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, macOS, Linux and other operating systems. It is built on top of the widely popular [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org/) and is being developed by a wide, diverse group of volunteers.

**Are you coming from [Audacium](https://github.com/Audacium/audacium) or [Saucedacity](https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/saucedacity-legacy)? You're in the right place!** We'd like to welcome all Audacium and Saucedacity users to Tenacity and our community. We've implemented new features from Audacity 3.1 to make editing easier. Additionally, we've preserved the themes of these two forks with only very slight modifications so they look better with our new editing features and slight track changes.

## Features

- **Recording** from audio devices (real or virtual)
- **Export / Import** a wide range of audio formats (extensible with FFmpeg)
- **High quality** including up to 32-bit float audio support
- **Plug-ins** providing support for VST, LV2, and AU plugins
- **Scripting** in the built-in scripting language Nyquist, or in Python, Perl and other languages with named pipes
- **Editing** arbitrary sampling and multi-track timeline
- **Accessibility** including editing via keyboard, screen reader support and narration support
- **Tools** useful in the analysis of signals, including audio

**Please Note**: This is an automatically updated package. If you find it is out of date by more than a day or two, please contact the maintainer(s) and let them know the package is no longer updating correctly.</description>
    <summary>Tenacity is an easy-to-use, privacy-friendly, FLOSS, cross-platform multi-track audio editor for Windows, macOS, Linux, and other operating systems https://tenacityaudio.org</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Today marks a day that will last forever in project history: Tenacity's first ever stable version was released. And before we get to anything, we do recognize odd version number due to historical technicalities with the codebase (Tenacity development was restarted using Saucedacity's codebase, which was at version 1.3 alpha). The work of many contributors has finally been brought to fruition with this latest stable release, and the more than a year long wait for a stable release of Tenacity is finally over.

# Contributors
We want to first start off with those that have contributed to Tenacity. Many different people were involved in adding new features, fixing bugs, enhancing existing features, changing things, and overall just making Tenacity better. Without them, we wouldn't have gotten as far as we did. All of your contributions are invaluable, and we can't express how grateful we are for them.

We'd like to thank the following, in alphabetical order of (user)name, for contributing to Tenacity to help make a better audio editor:

- [abb128](https://github.com/abb128)
- @akleja
- @AnErrupTion
- @Be
- @davidkaroly
- @generic-pers0n (Fine, I'll put myself on the list too :P)
- @jamesp
- [Mart Raudsepp](https://github.com/leio) (for help with HiDPI issues and past work)
- [Max Maisel](https://github.com/mmmaisel)
- @n0toose
- @nyanpasu64
- @orowith2os
- @robUx4
- @TheEvilSkeleton (for Flatpak)
- ...and many more, past, present, and future!

Finally, we'd like to thank the previous maintainers of Tenacity for their hard work in maintaining Tenacity and allowing Tenacity to be what it is: Tenacious.

## Release Advisories

We're adding this section to document important issues that you may encounter with upgrading from previous Tenacity betas to this stable release. We have a few advisories below. We will 

1. **Problem**: After upgrading, it is possible that all your effects, generators, tools, and any other plugins might disappear completely from their respective menus.

    - **Solution**: delete `pluginregistry.cfg` and `pluginsettings.cfg` from your configuration directory (`~/.var/app/org.tenacityaudio.Tenacity/config` on Linux under Flatpak, `C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Tenacity` under Windows). You will need to re-enable any plugins you had enabled previously.

2. **Problem**: your latency setting reads as samples instead of milliseconds in preferences.

    - **Solution**: change the unit back to milliseconds. Alternatively, you can use the new default of 512 samples. See the changelog for more details.

If you only use the default settings, it is generally recommended that you reset you preferences.

3. **Problem**: On Linux, JACK isn't available using the Flatpak but the appropriate packages are installed.

    - **Solution**: JACK is supported via Pipewire through the Flatpak. If your distro uses PulseAudio, consider setting up Pipewire if you can. Please consult your distro's documentation on how to setup Pipewire.

      - If your distro already has Pipewire setup by default but you still don't see the JACK option, try installing your distro's Pipewire JACK support package.

4. **Problem**: Some help buttons point to nonexistent documentation.

    - **Solution**: Unfortunately, there is none. We haven't been able to update all help buttons because we are still developing the manual. If interested, you can help us develop the manual here: https://codeberg.org/tenacityteam/tenacity-manual.

Now, let's get to the change log:

# Changelog

**Note**: this changelog tries to compare against Audacity 3.1.x, which is what this release is most similar too. Future changelogs will compare against previous versions of Tenacity. The next changelog will compare against this release.

## UI/UX
- Added new themes. We have new light, dark, and high contrast themes in addition to other themes, like the new Pro Tools theme.

  - If you are coming from either Saucedacity or Audacium, you may notice that some of these themes are slightly different as we've updated them for Tenacity.

  - Saucedacity's theme was modified to use Tenacity's icon set.

- Replace custom cursors with more modern ones.

- Added a new toolbar edit mode, which hides toolbar handles if disabled. This mode is enabled by default.

- Flattened borders around toolbar handles.

- Fixed visibility of the edit cursor when using dark themes.

- The edit cursor is now drawn over the entire TrackPanel rather than a single track.

- Remove 'Add/Remove Plugins...' from the Generate, Effect, and Analyze menus. Under 'Tools', the option remains but is now named 'Manage Plug-ins...'.

## Features

- Implement context menus for label tracks.

- Clips can now be snapped to the edit cursor. This applies when moving or resizing a 
clip.

- Added horizontal scrolling in the Frequency Analysis window (#135). Thanks @nyanpasu64!

- Native (i.e., without FFmpeg) Matroska importing and exporting with PCM and FLAC codecs is now possible in addition to importing Matroska chapters as label tracks (#175, #188, #189, #205, and #210). Thanks @robUx4!

## Changes

- The buffer length preference is now in samples by default. You can switch to milliseconds if you are unfamiliar with samples.

  - Buffer lengths now have a minimum requirement 32 samples, even if using milliseconds. (Tenacity converts this value internally based on the current sample rate).

  - The default buffer length is now 512 samples.

- The default sample rate is now 48 kHz.

## Effects

- Added new Dynamic Compressor effect by Max Maisel. Thank you for your awesome contribution!

## Technical

- Rewrote build system, resulting in all dependencies being devendored except for libnyquist. Thanks @Be!

  - Replace Conan with optional vcpkg for dependency management. vcpkg is enabled by default only on Windows &amp; macOS. We also disable vcpkg telemetry when enabled.

- Added Haiku support (#108, #118, and #119). Thanks @davidkaroly.

- Tenacity now sets the number of frames per buffer instead of suggested device latency. It also uses this value to allocate temporary buffers for its audio engine.

# FFmpeg
**Version:** 6.0
**License:** GPL v3 or later

FFmpeg releases provided for 1.3 are the same ones as provided for 1.3 beta 3.

# One More Thing...

We have one more thing to say...

# Thank you
Thank you for taking the time to look at this page. We don't expect you to read it all because it's a very long page, and this bit only makes it longer. However, we'll keep it short and sweet: your interest in Tenacity, whether it be downloading it, using it, even just looking at our website or Fediverse posts helps keep us motivated. It reassures us that there are people who care about the project, and that there is a community around it, even if it's just people who look at the project. To you, we say thank you.

Until the next release! :D</releaseNotes>
