    <releaseNotes>- Pressing Alt key when note options menu is open now toggles ???Move to trash??? option to ???Delete permanently???.
- Fixed: Sign out not occurring when uninstalling the app.
- Fixed: Clicking on ???View note??? button when attempting to view a protected note without a passcode/password set up would not dismiss the warning.
- Fixed: Note actions would sometimes display actions for the previous note instead of the current one.</releaseNotes>
